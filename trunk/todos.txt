* Comparison of DB SQL Flavors:
    http://troels.arvin.dk/db/rdbms/#select-limit

* Add Model.fromCSV/toCSV - this is a batch insert method, useful in tests and otherwise shoul be able to take a List<String>,
        String, InputStream, Reader, etc. First line is headers. Parametrize delimiter - comma, pipe, etc.

* Bulk updates need to somehow set the updated_at field.
* table name is still case sensitive, this needs to be fixed.
* Optimistic locking
* BUG::  insert into RISK_CATEGORY () values () if no attributes, query is not formed correctly
* created_at, updated_at for join tables in case join model not defined
* Allow setting of ID on model and still run insert instead of update on save();
* In class DB, cache other PreparedStatements for performance.
* LazyList needs to have where() method for getAll() methods
* Finish validations - all DSLs, and include resource bundles for messages (look into Locale as well)
* Add Model.create(Map), useful for web apps
