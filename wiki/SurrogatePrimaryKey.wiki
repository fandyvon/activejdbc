#summary usage of primary keys in ActiveJDBC
= Introduction =
Like !ActiveRecord, ActiveJDBC relies on surrogate primary keys in tables. 
For more information on surrogate keys, read here: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_key]

= Key name =
By convention, the primary key name is `id`. If your table has a surrogate primary key column with a name `id`, you do not have to do anything.

=Override primary key=

If your table cannot provide a primary key column named `id` (for instance due to corporate naming standards), you can override it with `@IdName` annotation. 

Example: let's say you have a table PEOPLE:
{{{
CREATE TABLE people (
  person_id int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  first_name              VARCHAR(124),
  last_name               VARCHAR(124),
)
}}}

You will then put annotation on the model:
{{{
@IdName("person_id")
public class Person extends Model{}
}}}

This way, the model will know to work with column `person_id` and not `id` as a primary key.
