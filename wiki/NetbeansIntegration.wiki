#summary How to integrate activejdbc instrumentation into Netbeans

= Introduction =

There were some questions regarding integration netbeans and activejdbc. 
I will try to describe the process and bottlenecks for such goal


= Details =

 * Create new netbeans project
 * Add dependent libraries:
   * Right click on the newly created project => Properties => Libraries
   * Add "Compile" libraries from [https://activejdbc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/examples/ant-example/lib/]
   * Add "Processor" libraries from [https://activejdbc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/examples/ant-example/build_time_libs/]
   * Close
 * Click "Files" tab and open build.xml
 * Add "-post-compile" target :
 {{{
<target name="-post-compile">
    <java classname="activejdbc.instrumentation.Main" failonerror="true">
        <sysproperty key="outputDirectory" value="${build.classes.dir}"/>
        <classpath>
            <pathelement path="${build.classes.dir}" />
            <pathelement path="${javac.classpath}" />
            <pathelement path="${javac.processorpath}" />
        </classpath>
    </java>
</target>
 }}}
 * Save and close the file

If you are running project from netbeans you need to perform additional step.
Right click on the project => Properties => Compiling => Uncheck "Compile on save"


That's all.
