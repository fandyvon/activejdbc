https://activejdbc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/inheritance_umlet_class_diagram.png


While there are total of 7 classes, only those classes that have green background are associated with tables. At the same time, a common functionality can be inherited from one class to another. Abstract classes are marked with (A).

In this diagram there are only three tables: MEALS, CAKES and SWORDS. This means that models that are not green are not backed by a table and therefore cannot be used directly.
