= Introduction =

ActiveJDBC provides two classes for connection management: [http://code.google.com/p/activejdbc/source/browse/trunk/activejdbc/src/main/java/activejdbc/Base.java Base.java] and [http://code.google.com/p/activejdbc/source/browse/trunk/activejdbc/src/main/java/activejdbc/DB.java DB.java]. 


=Thread connection propagation=

ActiveJDBC models when operate, utilize a connection found on a current thread. This connection is put on the local thread by Base or DB class before any DB operation. approach allows for more concise API where there is no need for DB Session or persistent managers as in other Java ORMs. 

Here is a simple program:

{{{
1. public static void main(String[] args) {
2.    Base.open("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver", "jdbc:mysql://localhost/test", "the_user", "the_password");
3.    Employee.findAll().dump();
4.    Base.close();
5. }
}}}

On line 1, class Base will open a new connection and attach it to the current thread. This connection will also be marked with name "default".
