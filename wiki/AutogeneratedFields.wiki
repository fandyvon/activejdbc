#summary What column values are generated by ActiveJDBC


= Introduction =

Like ActiveRecord, ActiveJDBC will enter special values into  columns that are named according to conventions. 

=created_at=
If a table that a model represents has this column (and the column type is one that corresponds to {{{java.sql.Timestamp}}}), then a model will enter value into this column only once when a new record is created. Successive updates of even new model instances that represent this specific record will not touch data in this column, hence your application logic can rely in this value.

= updated_at =

This column will be updated each time there an update to an existin record via ActiveJDBC Model API.

=Example: updated_at, created_at =
Let's say we have an empty table PEOPLE:

{{{
+----+------------+-----------+-----------------+-----------------+
| id | first_name | last_name | created_at      | updated_at      |
+----+------------+-----------+-----------------+-----------------+
}}}

A model will look like this:
{{{
public class Person{}
}}}

Let's add some records:
{{{
Person p = new Person();
p.set("first_name", "John", "last_name", "Smith");
p.saveIt();
}}}

At this point, we will have the following record in the DB:

{{{
+----+------------+-----------+---------------------+----------------------+
| id | first_name | last_name | created_at          | updated_at           |
+----+------------+-----------+---------------------+----------------------+
| 1  | John       | Smith     | 2010-08-12 10:36:02 | 2010-08-12 10:36:02  |
+----+------------+-----------+---------------------+----------------------+
}}}

As you can see, the dates are the same for created_at and updated_at. 

Then, within the same program or another, we will do the following:

{{{
Person john = Person.findById(1);
p.set("first_name", "John", "last_name", "Smithe");
p.saveIt();
}}} 

We corrected the last name from "Smith" to "Smithe". After this operation, the same record will look like this:


{{{
+----+------------+-----------+---------------------+----------------------+
| id | first_name | last_name | created_at          | updated_at           |
+----+------------+-----------+---------------------+----------------------+
| 1  | John       | Smith     | 2010-08-12 10:36:02 | 2010-08-13 12:45:22  |
+----+------------+-----------+---------------------+----------------------+
}}}

The updated_at column reflects when this record was last updated.
