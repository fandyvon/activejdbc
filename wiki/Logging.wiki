#summary Logging configuration

= Introduction =

ActiveJDBC uses [http://www.slf4j.org/ SLF4J] logging facade. Please, refer to SLF4J documentation to see how to configure it with Log4J, Java Logging, Apache logging, etc. 


=ActiveJDBC logging configuration=

ActiveJDBC uses a system property `activejdbc.log` for specifying logging. The value of this property can be:
  * blank - in this case, ActiveJDBC will spit out all available information - every SQL statement, cache hits/misses, cache purge events, etc.
  * regular expression - in this case, ActiveJDBC will only log statements that match a regular expression

If you just want to see all messages from ActiveJDBC, start your program like this:

{{{
java -Dactivejdbc.log com.acme.YourProgram
}}}

If you only want to see select messages, you can provide an expression:
{{{
java -Dactivejdbc.log=select.* com.acme.YourProgram
}}}

=Dynamically change log output=
Use this call:
{{{
activejdbc.LogFilter.setLogExpression("regular expression goes here");
}}}
to dynamically change ActiveJDBC log output at run time.
